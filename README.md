# SiteGenerator
Files in libs were not written by me, but are necessary for the project to run. They were provided by Richard McKenna at Stony Brook University. 

SiteGenerator is an editor for a course website where the user can input file locations and text data for use in a course website where the website will dynamically update using JSON files generated by this editor. 

SiteGenerator requires Java 8 with JavaFX as well as the JARs in the libs folder. Then sg.SiteGeneratorApp.java can be run.
